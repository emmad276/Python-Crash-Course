# Python Crash Course

Welcome to my Python Crash Course repository. This course covers the basics of Python, a dynamic and versatile programming language.

## Overview

- **Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- It is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable, and it supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- Python uses an **interpreter** to execute code line by line, unlike compiled languages such as C or Java that require compilation before execution.

## Key Points

- **Interpreter Language**: Python executes code line by line, making it an interpreter language.
- **Not a Compiled Language**: Python does not require compilation before execution, which allows for faster development cycles.
- **Superset of Python**: Mojo is an example of a superset of Python, much like how TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This means Mojo extends Python's capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Features of Python

- Easy to read and write.
- Strong community support and extensive libraries.
- Cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Suitable for both small scripts and large-scale applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Python:
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Create a simple Python script (`hello_world.py`):
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
